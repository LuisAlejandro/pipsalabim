``pipsalabim`` is just black magic.

Pip Sala Bim is a package that studies the codebase of your project in search
for internal and external imports. It then discards the imports that are
satisfied with internal code or with the standard library and finally
searches the `PyPIContents`_ index to list which packages satisfy your imports.
